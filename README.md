From night to day the iPhone became the biggest AR platform in the world. All that happened in 2017 when was announced a framework capable of change everything in augmented reality: ARKit.
At this year comes ARKit 3, improving what we had in previous versions plus new features like: people occlusion and motion capture (a great alternative to the old kinect).
In this talk you'll learn the difference between XR 3DoF and 6DoF, what's SLAM, anchor points, people occlusion, mocap, and we'll create your first AR app using the newest RealityKit (goodbye SceneKit and SpriteKit).
